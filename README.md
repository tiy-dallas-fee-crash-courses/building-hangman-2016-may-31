# Building Hangman in JavaScript

Welcome! In this crash course we're going to build a simple version of the game Hangman. This will be much easier to understand by those who have at least learned a little JavaScript but beginners should be able to pick up at least some of it.

There is a working copy of the page in the `complete` folder in this repository.

## Setup

1. You will need a text editor. I recommend using [Atom](https://atom.io/).
1. Chrome has *excellent* developer tools so I would recommend using it.
1. Download a copy of this repository from here on Github.
